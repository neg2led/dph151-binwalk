# Uplayerapp gets a regular allocation of time, for example 7ms every 10ms.
# After processing high priority pipelines the uplayerapp will use its
# remaining allocation for low priority pipelines.  Alpha is the ratio
# of the normal tick allocation that uplayerapp will try to use.  It's
# normally 1.0, but is reduced whenever uplayerapp detects that monitored
# apps are waiting too long to complete and decides to yield more time to
# them.  High-priority and mandatory low-priority pipelines will be able
# to use the full tick allocation, but flexible low-priority pipelines
# will be run last and will not use more than the reduced limit.

# For each process a limit in ticks is specified too.  This is how long
# the process normally takes between being woken up and it running to
# completion.  If the process takes longer than this to complete then the
# uplayerapp can reduce alpha to deschedule itself and yield more time.
# The limit should be small for apps that run to completion quickly.
# Apps that regularly run over many ticks will have a higher limit to
# avoid reducing the normal HS data throughput.
