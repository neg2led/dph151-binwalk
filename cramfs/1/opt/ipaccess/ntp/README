Overview
~~~~~~~~
- this project builds a version of the www.ntp.org ntp open source project patched 
  with local changes. Built binaries include ntpd. The build is performed in a 
  subdir created when the distribution tarball is expanded.

Performing Test Runs with ntpd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ntpd takes many hours to collect statistical data and produce low error 
measures of offset and frequency. In an effort to set up tests in a consistent
way and maximise the usefulness of collected data, a checklist of items needed 
to prepare a form factor card for running an ntpd test and collecting statistics 
follows:
- reboot card so there is no kernel state from a previous running instance of ntpd.
  ntpd uses the adjtimex syscall to program kernel state variables, so if ntpd has
  run before, old state will influence system behaviour.
- before rebooting the card, clear the message log e.g. 
    $ cat /dev/null > /var/log/messages
- after rebooting but before running the test, put a message in the message log 
  indicating that the test is about to start:
    $ logger "start of ntp_board_XX_test_YY_ddmmyy.txt"
  Here:
    - XX is the number of the form factor board.
    - YY is the number of the test.
    - dd is the date, mm is the month, yy is the year.
- have a script that periodically e.g. every 300s, calls:
    $ ntpq -np -crv >> ntp_board_XX_test_YY_ddmmyy.txt
  to record statistics from the running ntpd. Check that during the initial 
  training period that offset, frequency and stablility are 0.000 in the ntpq 
  results. Check that the ntpq results are appended to a the file rather than 
  overwriting the file every time results are logged.
