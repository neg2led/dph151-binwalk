#
# This script manages log files by checking their size, and if above
# a user defined limit, rotating the log file. The current log file
# is saved with a .0 extension and then truncated. If a saved log
# file with a .0 extension already exists, then it is deleted.
#
# The rotation is done either by copying the current logfile, then
# truncating the current log file, or by renaming the current log
# file then creating a new zero-length log file. The user can select
# which rotation method is used in the configration file (see below).
#
# The copy method is useful for programs which keep their log files
# open all the time, but needs free disk space equal to the log file
# size limit to be available when the log is rotated.
#
# The rename method can be used with programs which only open their
# log files when they need to write, and does not require any free
# disk space to do the rotate.
#
# Note that either method may lose a little bit of logging information
# when the log is rotated.
#
# This script just does one run through the list of log files it is
# managing each time it is run. It is intended that this script be
# run as a cron job, or by some other period process.
#
# The script uses a configuration file to tell it which log files
# to manage, what size limit applies to each log file, and the method
# to use to rotate the file.
#
# The configuraion file uses one line per log file as follows:
#
# <full path to logfile> <size limit in K> <rotation method>
#
# For example:
#
# /tmp/stunnel.log 512 copy
#
# This tells the script to managhe the /tmp/stunnel.log file, to limit
# its size to 512K and to rotate it with the copy method.
#
# The configuration file can contain comment lines which have a # in the
# first column and a space or newline in the second column. The configuration
# file cannot contain blank lines - this will be interpreted as the end of
# the file, and processing will stop at that point.
#
# The configuration file name can be supplied on the script command
# line, or defaults to managelogs.cfg in the current directory.
#

# Setup name of configuration file, either from command line or default
